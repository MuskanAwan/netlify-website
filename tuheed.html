           Islamic Aqeedah very simple clear without confusion well described in Quran hadith But Many internet articles/You tube/Forums debates of groups(Barelvis deobandis Salafis etc)has made it complex & has confused general muslims.So to educate Muslims1.Full Aqeedah of Islam on the way of sahaba2.No need of going in dilactic philosphical detail for general muslim3.To Stop the discussing where sahaba Imam Salaf has stopped.Effort will Free frm group mentality for sake of Islam and Mankind.</td>

             <font size="5" width="85%"> Belief in Allah and Tauheed (One ness of Allah)
            Allah says in the Qur'an:
             "He is the Lord of the heavens and the Earth and all that is in between them, so worship Him and be patient in His worship; do you know any equal to Him?" (19:65).
            Tauheed is anchor sheet for a muslim
            Obviously the most important of a muslim life is Tauheed (the oneness of Allah), this is like base and anchor sheet of Iman as all beliefs and actions are the command of Allah so tauheed and Iman of a muslim should be very firm and strong. He should have strong YAQEEN in his heart that only Allah has power to do the things.</font><br><br><br><br>
           <!--heading 3--> <h2><font size="6" color="#485b82"> ALLAH SAYS IN QURAN</font></h2>
           <font size="5">"Allah there is no God but He, the Living, the Everlasting. Slumber does not seize Him, neither sleep; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the Earth. Who is there that shall intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they do not encompass anything of His knowledge except what He wills. His throne extends over the heavens and the Earth, the preservation of them does not burden Him; He is the High, the Great.</font>

         <!--heading 4--> <h2><font size="6" color="#485b82"> QURANIC AYATS DETAILING TAUHEED</font></h2>
           <font size="5">"He creates what He pleases. He gives, to whom He wills, females, and He gives, to whom He wills, males, or He couples them, males and females; and He makes whom He wills barren. Surely, He is the Knowing, the Powerful" (42:49-50).
          "there is nothing whatever like unto Him, He is the All-hearing, the All-seeing. To Him belongs the keys of the Heavens and the Earth. He enlarges and restricts provisions to whom He wills. Surely He has knowledge of everything" (42:11-12).
           "there is no creature that moves on the Earth but its provision depends on Allah. He knows its dwelling and its resting place. All is recorded in a clear book" (11:6).
          We believe that "with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them but He. He knows what is in land and sea; not a leaf falls, but He knows it. Not a grain in the deep darkness of the Earth, not a thing green or dry but it is in a clear Book" (6 :5 9 ).
          We believe that "Allah alone has the knowledge of the Hour, sends down rain, and knows what is in the wombs. No soul knows what it shall earn tomorrow, and no soul knows in what land it shall die. Surely, Allah is All-knowing,Â All-aware </font>
